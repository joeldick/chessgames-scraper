# Chessgames.com Scraper

This project scrapes metadata and PGN data from [Chessgames.com](https://www.chessgames.com/) for a list of game URLs. It outputs:

- A CSV file containing metadata for each game (players, result, location, opening, etc.)
- A `.pgn` file with all game data, formatted cleanly for use in PGN viewers or databases
- A list of failed game IDs, if any

## 📦 Required Packages

These are installed automatically from requirements.txt:

- requests
- pycountry
- chess

## 🧠 Opening Detection Logic

Opening names are assigned based on FEN positions matched from a cleaned opening database (`eco-codes/opening_names.csv`). The logic walks through each move in a game, checking whether the current board state matches any known FENs in the database.
