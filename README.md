# Chessgames.com Scraper

This project scrapes metadata and PGN data from [Chessgames.com](https://www.chessgames.com/) for a list of game URLs. It outputs:

- A CSV file containing metadata for each game (players, result, location, opening, etc.)
- A `.pgn` file with all game data, formatted cleanly for use in PGN viewers or databases
- A list of failed game IDs, if any

- [`pycountry`](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/)
- [`chess`](https://pypi.org/project/chess/)

## üöÄ Usage

1. Add game URLs to `input/urls.txt`, one per line. Example:

```
https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1060718
https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1451573
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

## üì¶ Required Packages

These are installed automatically from requirements.txt:

- requests
- pycountry
- chess

## üß† Opening Detection Logic

Opening names are assigned based on FEN positions matched from a cleaned opening database (`eco-codes/opening_names.csv`). The logic walks through each move in a game, checking whether the current board state matches any known FENs in the database.
