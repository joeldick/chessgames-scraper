{Usually in this variation, what with the White Kt on c3, this
move wins a tempo which makes all the difference and gives
Black the superior position. Here, however, the move loses an
important tempo which should have better been used for
development.} 10. Nb3 Bb6 11. Qd3 {! Lasker now refutes the
ill- considered pawn-push very shrewdly. Since his pawn would
get lost by Rd1, Black must go in for an unfavourable
exchange.} Be6 12. Rd1 Bxb3 13. Qxb3 {Here, as will soon be
evident, the White Queen is excellently placed.} Qe7 {So as to
dodge the attack of the e-pawn. Black's position now looks
reasonably good, but he is a tempo behind in develop men and
that makes all the difference.} 14. Bd2 O-O 15. a4 {A very
subtle move, the force of which Black fails to recognise. The
pawn is to push on to a6 so as to loosen the position of the
Black pieces, particularly the Queen Knight. Naturally Black
must not take the e-pawn since 16 Re1 Qa6 17 Bf1 would cost
him the Queen.} Ne4 {It would have been best to stop the
further advance of the pawn by either ...Bc5 or a6 but White
would have had the better game in any case; Black's position,
though, may still have been tenable, whereas now it breaks
down very quickly.} 16. Be1 Rad8 {? Rac8!} 17. a5 Bc5 18. a6
bxa6 {After ...b6 White would still maintain his advantage by
19 Qa4 followed by 20 b4.} 19. Rac1 Rc8 20. Nh4 {Forcing
material gain, since White threatens to win the Knight or the
Bishop.} Bb6 21. Nf5 Qe5 22. Bxe4 Qxe4 23. Nd6 Qxe2 24. Nxc8
Rxc8 {For the loss of the exchange Black, at any rate, has a
strong passed pawn which might enable him to save the game so
long as he can avoid the exchange of rooks.} 25. Qd5 Qe6
26. Qf3 {At this juncture the exchange of queens would not be
quite favourable enough for White.} h6 27. Bd2 Ne5 28. Rxc8+
Qxc8 29. Qe4 Nd7 30. Rc1 Qf8 31. Bxh6 {!} Nc5 {If ...gxh6
White would regain the piece by 32 Qg4+.} 32. Qg4 f5 33. Qg6
Qf7 34. Qxf7+ Kxf7 35. Bg5 Nd3 36. Rb1 {Not, of course, Rc2
since Black would win a piece by ...Ne1 followed by ...Nf3+.}
Ke6 37. b3 Kd5 38. f3 a5 39. h4 Nc5 40. h5 d3 {Black is
hopelessly lost since there is no way to stop White from
getting a passed Pawn on the King's-wing.} 41. Kf1 a4 42. bxa4
Nxa4 43. Bf6 {!} Ke6 44. Bxg7 Kf7 45. Be5 Nc5 46. Rd1
{Obviously the d-pawn will get lost. A beautifully played
game, but then almost all of Lasker's games in this Tournament
are worthy of a World Champion.} 1-0

1. e4 {Notes by Bobby Fischer} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4
Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 {On and off, White resorts to this solid
and still respected system (championed by Smyslov) whenever
the sharper tries fail.} e5 {Black's expectation in this
Najdorf Variation is that his control of important central
squares, with possibilities of Q-side expansion, will more
than compensate for the slight weakness of his backward QP.}
7. Nb3 Be6 {To provoke f4-5 weakening White's KP.} 8. O-O Nbd7
9. f4 Qc7 10. f5 Bc4 11. a4 {To hinder ...b5.} Be7 {Better
than 11...Rc8 12 a5 Be7 13 Bxc4 Qxc4 14 Ra4 Qc7 15 Be3 h6 16
Rf2 with a bind. (Schmid-Evans, Varna 1962)} 12. Be3 O-O

followed by h4.} 14. axb6 Nxb6 15. Bxb6 {? At Curacao 1962,
Geller had found the right line : 15 Kh1! Rfc8 16 Bxb6 Qxb6 17
Bxc4 Rxc4 18 Qe2 Rb4 19 Ra2! and Black is hard-pressed to
defend his a-pawn, but 19...h6! 20 Rfa1 Bf8 21 Rxa6 Rxa6 22
Rxa6 Qb7 23 Na5 Qc7 24 Nb3 Qb7 (Zuckerman)=.} Qxb6+ 16. Kh1
Bb5 {! Intending ...Bc6 followed by a5.} 17. Bxb5 {White has
alredy dissipated his theoretical advantage. He should settle
for 17 Nxb5 axb5 18 Qd3 with opposite colored Bishops.} axb5
18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. Qxd5 Ra4 {! Avoids conceding the a-file and
puts pressure on the KP.} 20. c3 Qa6 21. h3 {It's hard for
White to hit upon a constructive plan. At Curacao 1962, Tal
played against me 21 Rad1 Rc8 22 Nc1 b4 23 Nd3!? (White's in a
bad way anyhow) bxc3 24 bxc3 and now ...Rxc3 (instead of my
...Ra5 lemon) wins outright. If 25 Nxe5 dxe5 26 Qxe5 (Qd8+
Bf8!) Bb4! 27 Qxc3 Qxf1+! (Kmoch).} Rc8 22. Rfe1 h6 {! A handy
'luft', as becomes apparent later.} 23. Kh2 Bg5 24. g3 {?
Creating more K-side weaknesses. Better is 24 Rad1.} Qa7
25. Kg2 Ra2 26. Kf1 {What else? On 26 Rxa2 Qxa2 27 Re2 Rxc3!
Now Black has a decisive shot.} Rxc3 {! On 27 Rxa2 (27 bxc3
Qf2 mate) Rf3+ 28 Ke2 Rf2+ 29 Kd3 Qxa2 30 Ra1 Qxb2
wins. Black's first rank is no longer vulnerable since the
King can escape to h7 on the check.} 0-1
